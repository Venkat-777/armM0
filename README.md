# ARM Cortex-M0 System-on-Chip (SoC) Project

Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an ARM Cortex-M0 based System-on-Chip (SoC). The SoC includes an AHB-Lite bus that connects various peripherals, such as RAM and LEDs, to the ARM Cortex-M0 processor. The project was developed as part of an ARM course, and the provided code serves as a foundation for building embedded systems with the ARM Cortex-M0 architecture.
